2D Boids

I would bet that you are familiar with these but for my reference I'll explain

Boids are a simulation of flocking birds that follow a few relatively simple rules that are stated below:

Alignment: 
Align with the average orientation of the local group (Main trajectory of the flock)

Separation: 
Avoid being too close to neighbors (No conflicts inside the flock)

Cohesion: 
Move toward the average position of the local group (Compactness of the flock)

I also want to include a few other things I have been wanting to experiment with
each of these are listed below please let me know if you thing I am reaching too high for 
the extent of this course.  it shouldn't be too difficult to pare things down to a more 
manageable goal by using code other people have already written in place of writing everything 
from scratch. 

Custom pseudo-random generator
Dear ImGui (dynamic user interfaces)
OpenGL (graphics rendering)
GLFW (window creation, user input handling, context management?)
GLM (mathematics operations)
